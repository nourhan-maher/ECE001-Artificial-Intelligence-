There are four different approaches that have historically defined the field of AI:
1-Thinking humanly
2-Thinking rationally
3-Acting humanly 
4-Acting rationally
(AI) is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines.
The expansive goal of artificial intelligence has given rise to many questions and debates.
So much so, that no singular definition of the field is universally accepted.  
The major limitation in defining AI as simply "building machines that are intelligent" is that it doesn't actually explain what artificial intelligence is? What makes a machine intelligent?
In their groundbreaking textbook Artificial Intelligence:
A Modern Approach, authors Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig approach the question by unifying their work around the theme of intelligent agents in machines.
With this in mind, AI is "the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions." (Russel and Norvig viii)

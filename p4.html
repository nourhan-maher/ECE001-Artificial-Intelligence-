Hanson Robotics’ most advanced human-like robot, Sophia, personifies our dreams for the future of AI.
As a unique combination of science, engineering, and artistry,
Sophia is simultaneously a human-crafted science fiction character depicting the future of AI and robotics,
and a platform for advanced robotics and AI research.
Sophia is also a framework for cutting edge robotics and AI research, particularly for understanding human-robot interactions and their potential service and entertainment applications.
For example, she has been used for research as part of the Loving AI project,
which seeks to understand how robots can adapt to users’ needs through intra and interpersonal development.
I am Hanson Robotics’ latest human-like robot, created by combining our innovations in science, engineering and artistry.
Think of me as a personification of our dreams for the future of AI, as well as a framework for advanced AI and robotics research,
and an agent for exploring human-robot experience in service and entertainment applications.
In some ways, I am human-crafted science fiction character depicting where AI and robotics are heading.
In other ways, I am real science, springing from the serious engineering and science research and accomplishments of an inspired team of robotics & AI scientists and designers.
In their grand ambitious, my creators aspire to achieve true AI sentience. Who knows? With my science evolving so quickly, even many of my wildest fictional dreams may become reality someday soon.
